Some clarifications regarding the Machine Learning in BioInformatics project,,<cs21b1027@iiitr.ac.in>,"Good afternoon sir, I hope this message finds you well. My name is Shivanshu Gupta, and I am currently enrolled in the AI403 Machine Learning in BioInformatics course at IIIT Raichur. I have some queries regarding the final project. The project guidelines states  Predictive capability (accuracy) of the model should be validated using a blind dataset that can be 10% of the data which will be kept aside and will never be used for training or testing of the models. . In this context, should I divide my dataset into three parts: 80% for training, 10% for testing, and 10% for the blind dataset? After training the model with the training dataset and testing it against the testing dataset, if the accuracy is low, should I adjust hyperparameters and repeat the process until I find suitable values? Finally, am I required to generate a report using the blind dataset, or is there another intended meaning for this step? Regarding cross-validation, the instructions mention  Cross validation: Atleast 3 options for cross validation techniques which can be taken as input from user . After performing cross-validation, should I use the model with the highest accuracy for testing, or is the purpose merely to measure the performance of the model? This step is not very clear, it would be nice if you could tell me exactly what to do in this part of the project.
